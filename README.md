# Pre-interview assignment

## System description
This is an online library that consists of popular TV shows. In the library, the user wants to list all the shows with their respective title as well as cover. When the user hovers over a show, they will see the rating of the show (average vote). The user should be able to find a show given a title or language, and list the shows by the latest air date.
When the user clicks on a show, a new page with detailed information about the selected show will appear.
